# my-first-website-

Hi, this is Ashley!

This program is the first ever website I have programmed way back when I was in Grade 12.
I did this as my final project in our Arts subject in which we were required to create
any type of masterpiece. And I did not hesitate to develop this simple website that
features my creativity and skills in HTML and CSS.

You will notice some flaws in my code and that's because I was purely naive and new to HTML
and CSS that time. And to serve as a practice, I have decided to copy an existing website,
challenging myself if I could put to life the same beautiful website with my own 
logic and skills in using HTML and CSS.

Thank you for reading this up here. Have fun! And have a good day!
